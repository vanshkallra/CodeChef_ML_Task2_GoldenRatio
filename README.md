The Golden Ratio, often denoted by the Greek letter φ (phi), is a mathematical constant that appears in various natural phenomena, art, architecture, and design. Its value is approximately 1.618033988749895, but it is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.

The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1, and the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. The Fibonacci Sequence has applications in various fields including mathematics, computer science, and nature.

As you progress through the Fibonacci Sequence, if you take the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers (e.g., 13/8, 21/13, 34/21, etc.), you will find that these ratios approach the Golden Ratio. The larger the Fibonacci numbers, the closer the ratio gets to φ.

This phenomenon is not a coincidence; it arises from the recursive nature of the Fibonacci Sequence. As the Fibonacci numbers grow larger, the ratio of consecutive numbers converges towards the Golden Ratio.

Question:

Write a Python function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number and then uses it to approximate the Golden Ratio.

Expectations:
First write the function of Fibonacci Sequence (recursive function with base case)
Next, write the function for Golden Ratio Approximation that includes base case of n<2 and returns the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci  numbers
Finally, display the Fibonacci sequence and the approximate Golden Ratio
